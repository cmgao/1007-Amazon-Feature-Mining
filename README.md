DSGA 1007 Final Project

Amazon is the leading ecommerce market for various products. The popularity of the site and the diversity of the products means that many consumers trust reviews to help them choose their product. 



Often, reviewers will detail certain aspects of each product that they feel satisfaction/dissatisfaction toward, in addition to sentiment towards the product (i.e. emotional words like “love” or “happy”). Sentiment analysis can give insight into how people feel toward various features of their product and where they can improve upon. 


Our proposed research question is: Based on customer reviews, can we determine the most popular product features from Amazon customer reviews, and of these features which are the strongest indicators of customer sentiment about a product?
